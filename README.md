<h2> Object-oriented programming (OOP) </h2>
Explain the motivation for OOP
Problems with procedural programming
•	Data separated from functions
•	Last of modularity
•	High coupling
•	Re-use difficult
•	Not modelling the real world
Different entities into one unit (Class) 

Describe the expected benefits of OOP
•	Data and functions combined
•	Better modularity
•	Low coupling
•	Re-use easier closely modelling the real world

State the four main principles of OOP
•	Abstraction
•	Encapsulation
•	Inheritance
•	Polymorphism


<h2>Abstraction</h2>
Explain the OOP principle of Abstraction
The unit of abstraction is Class
  An object is an instance of a class
A class is a type of object


Example of Abstraction in the real world
Understand how abstraction applies to programming
Encapsulation
Provide a simple, consistent interface to use the object
Hide data and implementation details inside
Each class has a well-defined responsibility
